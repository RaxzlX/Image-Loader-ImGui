# Image-Loader-ImGui

FYI: Search "//Added" In My "main.cpp" To See Every Thing I Changed From The Normal Imgui "main.cpp"

(Steps)

1. Download ImGui: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

2. Download MyImage01.jpg, And Place It In "C:" (Or You Can Change The File Location in My "main.cpp")  
(bool ret = LoadTextureFromFile("YOURLOCATION\\MyImage01.jpg", &my_texture, &my_image_width, &my_image_height);) 

3. Replace "main.cpp" In "example_win32_directx9" Folder With My "main.cpp"
